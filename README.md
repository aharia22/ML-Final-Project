# ML-Final-Project

## Introduction

The inspiration for this project comes from the publication: Novel Biomarker Prediction for Lung Cancer Using Random Forest Classifiers
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10126698/)

The data used for this analysis is Illumina Hiseq2500 RNA-seq data found at NCBI SRA under the project ID SRP117020. Samples were obtained from 130 patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
The data contains sequences with distribution of poor to well differentiated adenocarcinomas and squamous cell cancers

The reference genome used for alignment can be found here: (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001405.26/).
